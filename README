TwitPolitics is a set of Python scripts for scraping tweets from the Twitter timelines of a set of given usernames. The intent behind their creation was to collect & analyze tweets sent by GOP Presidential candidates during the 2012 GOP primary campaign season, but the code could easily be adapted for other datasets and analyses.
